# UdacityQuizApp
In this project I built the Udacity Quiz App which is the last project for the android basic course and also part of the  Andela 7days of coding challenge
I made the options for the radiobuttons easier by putting them in a radiogroup
In terms of styling I didnt do much but functionally the app works and it is able to get the results and display in no time through a toast message
There were other options too using checkboxes, althopugh i dont know how efficient my java is but I had to write codes for each of the possible combinations
The app is hosted on my Google Drive and is downloadable on this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nCQcHJLd-BjEQGUNIiO_I67zbt89Hd-I
Have fun with!
